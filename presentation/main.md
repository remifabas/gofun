# *Go Introduction*

![width:250px](images/go-athors.png)![width:250px](images/3gophers.png)
* Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike & Ken Thompson
* For them, C++ is awesome on the runtime side, but complex to use and with too much compilation time. Java does better on the compilation side, but still too complex to use. Python is easy to use, but not fast enough. 
---

# *Go main features*

* near c++ performance
* Static Typing and gc
* compilation to machine code directly cross-comp & small binary size, __statically linked__ (i.e. no dependecy)
* Powerful Standard Library (net/http) and Tool Set
* 'Cloud Native'
* __Concurrency__ üöÄ
* borring to read ü§Ø

# ![width:100px](images/gophercises_jumping.gif)*Compilation !*

*¬´ You can compile and run a go program faster than some interpreters can even start ¬ª Rob Pike*

```
[~/go/src/gitlab.com/remi.fabas/gofun] ‚ù±‚ù±‚ù± go build -o mybin main.go 
[~/go/src/gitlab.com/remi.fabas/gofun] ‚ù±‚ù±‚ù± ./mybin 
Hello there ü§ñ
```

other system or architecture ?
```
env GOOS=linux go build main.go # or android / windows ...
env GOARCH=arm go build main.go # or amd64, wasm ...
```

# ![width:100px](images/flash.png)*Dependencies !*

*¬´ You can compile and run a go program faster than some interpreters can even start ¬ª Rob Pike*

```
[~] ‚ù±‚ù±‚ù± go mod init gitlab.com/remi.fabas/gofun
```

all dependencies listed in a go.mod file
```
[~] ‚ù±‚ù±‚ù± go mod tidy    # remove/add dependencies listed in you go files
[~] ‚ù±‚ù±‚ù± go mod vendor  # download all dependencies in vendor folder

# ![width:100px](images/poking-fire.png)*OOP ?*

* Structures rather than classes 

```GO
type Cat struct {
    color string
}

func main() {
    // shortcut: declaration + assignment
    garfield := Cat{color: "orange"}

    // declaration
    var schrodingerCat Cat
    //assignment
    schrodingerCat.color = "don't know"

    fmt.Println(garfield, schrodingerCat)
}
```

---
# ![width:100px](images/musclor.gif)*OOP ?*
* No inheritances but composition
```GO
type Cat struct {
	catFur fur
}

type fur struct {
	color    string
	hasSpots bool
}
...
garfield := Cat{
    catFur: fur{
        color:    "orange",
        hasSpots: true,
    },
}
```

# ![drop-shadowwidth:200px](images/chadgourtines.jpeg)*Goroutines*

* Independently executing function
* Own call stack, which grows and shrinks as required.
* Very cheap. 2kb != 1MB for default thread in Java
* It's not a thread.
* There might be only one thread in a program with thousands of goroutines.
* But if you think of it as a very cheap thread, you won't be far off. 

---

#  ![drop-shadow width:250px](images/channels.png) *Channels*

* connection between two goroutines, allowing them to communicate. [try it](https://go.dev/play/p/1u7znSbNuPV) 

```go
// Declaring and initializing.
var c chan int
c = make(chan int)
// or
c := make(chan int)

// Sending on a channel.
c <- 1
// Receiving from a channel.
// The "arrow" indicates the direction of data flow.
value = <-c
